## About Python Framework
Python Web framework is a collection of packages or modules that 
allow developers to write Web applications or services.
 With it, developers don't need to handle low-level details like protocols,
 sockets or process/thread management.

 ## Popular framework lists
 - Django
 - Masonite
 - Turbo Gears
 - Web2py

 ## How many framework are there in Python?
 - namely full stack
 - micro-framework
 - asynchronous.

# PEP
 ## What is PEP?

The PEP is an abbreviation form of Python Enterprise Proposal. Writing code with proper logic is a key factor of programming, but many other important factors can affect the code's quality. The developer's coding style makes the code much reliable, and every developer should keep in mind that Python strictly follows the way of order and format of the string.

Adaptive a nice coding style makes the code more readable. The code becomes easy for end-user.

PEP 8 is a document that provides various guidelines to write the readable in Python. PEP 8 describes how the developer can write beautiful code. It was officially written in 2001 by Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw, and Nick Coghlan. The main aim of PEP is to enhance the readability and consistency of code.

 ## Why PEP 8 is Important?

PEP 8 enhances the readability of the Python
code, but why is readability so important? Let's understand this concept.

Creator of Python, Guido van Rossum said, "Code is much more often than it is written." The code can be written in a few minutes, a few hours, or a whole day but once we have written the code, we will never rewrite it again. But sometimes, we need to read the code again and again.

At this point, we must have an idea of why we wrote the particular line in the code. The code should reflect the meaning of each line. That's why readability is so much important.

We will describe few important guidelines for writing effective code that can be read by others as well.
