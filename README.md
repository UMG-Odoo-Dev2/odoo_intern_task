# PEP
## Python Enhancement Proposal
> PEP 8 exists to improve the readability and consistency of Python code.
### Naming 
> When we write Python Code, to choose sensible names of variables, classes, functions and packages and so on.
### Blank Line
1. To put extra vertical blank line in top level functions and classes.
2. To leave only single line if inside a class, functions are all related to one another.
3. To leave a blank line inside a complicated function complete several steps before the return statement.
### Maximum Line Length & Line Breaking
1. To write within parentheses, brackets, or braces if the code is contained.
2. Can use the backslashes to break line
3. To break before binary operators if line breaking needs to occur around binary operators, like + and * .
### Identation
> Tell the Python what code to execute when the function is called or what code belongs to be a class
