## PEP
- Python Enterprise Proposal
- A design document that provides various guidelines to write the readable in **Python**
- Creator of Python said,
 *"Code is  much more often than it is written"*
 
  Few important guidelines for writing effective code that can be read by others are as follows:
  
   #### 1. Name Conversion
  - Selecting a proper name saves time and energy.
  - Eg. CapitalizedWords *NumberOfBooks=5*

   #### 2. Code Layout
  - How much the code is readable 
  - Eg. Indentation that determines the level of lines of code
  ```
  x=20
  if x>10:
    print("x is larger than 10")
  ```  
    #### 3. Importing Module
    - Eg. Import sys
    #### 4. Blank Lines
    - If many lines of code bunched together the code will become harder to read
    - This problem can be overcome by using many blank vertical lines
    #### 5. Put the Closing Braces
    #### 6. Comments
    #### 7. Avoid Unnecessay White Spaces

## Types of Python Framework
- The framework is a collection of modules and packages
- Using Python frameworks helps reducing development time as it provides a prebuilt implementation of redundant tasks
- There are majorly three types of frameworks as follows
  #### 1. Full Stack Framework
  #### 2. Micro Framework
  #### 3. Asynchronous Framework

### Top Python Frameworks
1. Bottle
2. Django
3. Web2Py
4. Flask
5. CherryPy
