PEP
#######
The PEP is an abbreviation form of Python Enterprise Proposal. Writing code with proper logic is a key factor of programming, but many other important factors can affect the code's quality. The developer's coding style makes the code much reliable, and every developer should keep in mind that Python strictly follows the way of order and format of the string.

Adaptive a nice coding style makes the code more readable. The code becomes easy for end-user.
PEP 8 is a document that provides various guidelines to write the readable in Python. PEP 8 describes how the developer can write beautiful code. It was officially written in 2001 by Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw, and Nick Coghlan. The main aim of PEP is to enhance the readability and consistency of code.

Why PEP 8 is Important?
#################################
PEP 8 enhances the readability of the Python
code, but why is readability so important? Let's understand this concept.

Creator of Python, Guido van Rossum said, "Code is much more often than it is written." The code can be written in a few minutes, a few hours, or a whole day but once we have written the code, we will never rewrite it again. But sometimes, we need to read the code again and again.

At this point, we must have an idea of why we wrote the particular line in the code. The code should reflect the meaning of each line. That's why readability is so much important.

We will describe few important guidelines for writing effective code that can be read by others as well.
 
#################################################
How many PEP are there?
#################################################
There are three kinds of PEP: A Standards Track PEP describes a new feature or implementation for Python. It may also describe an interoperability standard that will be supported outside the standard library for current Python versions before a subsequent PEP adds standard library support in a future version

PEP Index
########################################
This PEP contains the index of all Python Enhancement Proposals, known as PEPs. PEP numbers are assigned by the PEP editors, and once assigned are never changed. The version control history of the PEP texts represent their historical record. The PEPs are indexed by topic for specialist subjects
