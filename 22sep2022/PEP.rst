Python Enhancement Proposal
---------------------------
* PEP describes how the developer can write beautiful code
* PEP 8 enhance the readibility of Python code

:Code Lay-out:

- Indentation
    - Use 4-space per indentation level
- Tabs or Spaces
    - Spaces are preferred indentation method
    - Python disallows mixing tabs and space for indentation
- Maximum Line Length
    - Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters

:White Spaces:

- Don't use white sapce if not necessary

:Comments:

- Use comment when you code to know what the code is intend for.

:Naming Conventions:

- Naming Conventions in Python are a little bit complex. So you should be careful.
