# PEP
>Python Enhancement Proposal
- PEP is comprehensive styling guide for Python code. Python maintains a strict way of order and format of scripting.
- For Python, PEP 8 has emerged as the style guide that most projects adhere to; it promotes a very readable and eye-pleasing coding style.
1. Use 4-space indentation and no tabs.
   - ***This 4 space rule is not always mandatory***
2. Use docstrings
   - ***There are both single and multi-line docstrings that can be used in Python*** 
3. Wrap lines so that they don’t exceed 79 characters 
4. Use of regular and updated comments 
   - ***Block comments and inline comments can be written by single ‘#’***
5. Use of trailing commas 
   - ***This is not mandatory except while making a tuple***
6. Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside bracketing constructs:
    - ***For example; a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4)***
7. Naming Conventions
    - ***a (single lowercase letter)***
    - ***B (single upper case letter)***
    - ***lowercase***
    - ***lower_case_with_underscores***
    - ***UPPERCASE***
    - ***UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES***
    - ***CapitalizedWords (or CamelCase).***
    - ***mixedCase***
    - ***Capitalized_Words_With_Underscores***
8. Characters that should not be used for identifiers 
9. Don’t use non-ASCII characters in identifiers
