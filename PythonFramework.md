# Python Framework

## About Python Framework
Python Web framework is a collection of packages or modules that 
allow developers to write Web applications or services.
 With it, developers don't need to handle low-level details like protocols,
 sockets or process/thread management.

## How many frameworks are in Python?
There are primarily three types of Python frameworks, namely full-stack, micro-framework, and asynchronous.

## What is the difference between a full-stack framework and a micro framework?
Anything outside of a full-stack framework is technically a “nonfull-stack framework.” Of that group, if the framework and libraries are smaller than “5k,” or 5,000 lines of code, it is known as a micro-framework. Micro-frameworks leave out many of the components of a full-stack setup, including: Web template engine

## What is microframework Python?
Type – Microframework Dash is an open-source Python-based framework for building analytical web applications. It is an ideal Python framework for data scientists that aren't much into the mechanics of web development

## What is a micro web framework?
A microframework is a term used to refer to minimalistic web application frameworks. It is contrasted with full-stack frameworks. It lacks most of the functionality which is common to expect in a full-fledged web application framework, such as: Accounts, authentication, authorization, roles.

## When would you use a micro framework?
Micro-frameworks are better for smaller projects that require simplicity, low overhead, and rapid deployment.

## full-stack framework
A full-stack development framework is designed to be utilized repetitively by developers to program applications without manually creating the regularly used generic codes from scratch. To put it simply, they are bodies of pre-written code used by developers to create apps using the Java programming language.

## Is Python part of full-stack?
A full stack Python developer uses the Python programming language for the development of the entire technology stack of a web application. Python is a computer programming language that has become one of the more popular for application development.

## Why is full stack important?
Full stack developers ensure the openness of application and they also work alongside graphic designers as well for features of web design and many other tasks. They are necessary to look into web projects from the start to its final form

## What is asynchronous framework?
Asynchronous programming is a form of parallel programming that allows a unit of work to run separately from the primary application thread. When the work is complete, it notifies the main thread.

## What is asynchronous framework in Python?
asyncio is used as a foundation for multiple Python asynchronous frameworks that provide high-performance network and web-servers, database connection libraries, distributed task queues, etc. asyncio is often a perfect fit for IO-bound and high-level structured network code.

## Asynchronous purpose
- Image result for the goal of asynchronous framework
Asynchronous programming allows a user to go about his business in an application, while processes run in the background, thus enhancing the user experience. 
- Here's an example: Data may take long a long time to submit to a database.

## What is the benefit of asynchronous processing?
One of the main benefits of running asynchronous Apex is higher governor and execution limits. For example, the number of SOQL queries is doubled from 100 to 200 queries when using asynchronous calls
