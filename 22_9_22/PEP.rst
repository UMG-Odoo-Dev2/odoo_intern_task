PEP-Python Enhancement Proposal
---------------------------------
- one of the most readable and eye-pleasing coding styles

**Code Layout**
    - Indentation
        - Use 4 spaces per indentation level
    - Tabs or Spaces
        - Spaces are the preferred indentation method.
        - Tabs should be used solely to remain consistent with code that is already indented with tabs.
        - Python disallows mixing tabs and spaces for indentation.
    - Maximum line length
        - Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters
    - Blank line
        - Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.
        - Method definitions inside a class are surrounded by a single blank line.
**White spaces**
    - don't use to much if not necessary
**Comments**
        -should be up-to-date when the code changes and should be clear and easily understandable
