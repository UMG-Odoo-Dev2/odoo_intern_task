### Python Frameworks
- support software development project
- save time on development
### Three main types of Python Framework
1. Full Stack Framework
> - suitable for both back-end and front-end development
> - a one-stop solution for all developer requirements
> - sizeable because they contain several modules, components and services
> - will carry all the equipment you need to facilitate full-stack development
> - `eg- Django, CubicWeb`

2. Microframework
> - opposite of a full stack framework
> - refer to minimalistic web application frameworks
> - lightweight frameworks that don’t offer additional functionalities and features
> - need to add a lot of code and additional requirements manually like third-party libraries when completely necessary
> - `eg- Bottle, CherryPy, Dash`

3. Asynchronous Framework
> - a microframework that allows for handling a large set of concurrent connections
> - a form of parallel programming that allows a unit of work to run separately from the primary application thread
> - asynchronous code is non-blocking and doesn’t wait for one event to execute before starting another
> - `eg- AIOHTTP, Tulip, Tornado, and Twisted`
