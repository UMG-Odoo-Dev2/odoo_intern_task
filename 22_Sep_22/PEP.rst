-----------------------------
* PEP is comprehensive styling guide for Python code. Python maintains a strict way of order and format of scripting.
* For Python, PEP 8 has emerged as the style guide that most projects adhere to; it promotes a very readable and eye-pleasing coding style.

    * Use 4-space indentation and no tabs.
        - *this 4 space rule is not always mandatory*
    * Use docstrings
        - *There are both single and multi-line docstrings that can be used in Python* 
    * Wrap lines so that they don’t exceed 79 characters 
    * Use of regular and updated comments 
        - *Block comments and inline comments can be written by single Hash Sign*
    * Use of trailing commas 
        - *This is not mandatory except while making a tuple*
    * Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside bracketing constructs:
        - *For example; a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4)*
    * Naming Conventions
        - *a (single lowercase letter)*
        - *B (single upper case letter)*
        - *lowercase*
        - *lower_case_with_underscores*
        - *UPPERCASE*
        - *UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES*
        - *CapitalizedWords (or CamelCase)*
        - *mixedCase*
        - *Capitalized_Words_With_Underscores*
    * Characters that should not be used for identifiers 
    * Don’t use non-ASCII characters in identifiers
