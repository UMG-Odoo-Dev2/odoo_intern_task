# Python

## Defination of Python
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming.

# About Python framework
Python Web framework is a collection of packages or modules that allow developers to write Web applications or services. With it, developers don't need to handle low-level details like protocols, sockets or process/thread management.

There are primarily three types of Python frameworks, namely full-stack, micro-framework, and asynchronous. Before moving on to discussing the best Python frameworks to go for in 2022, let’s first take a brief look into the various types of Python frameworks.

# Types of Python Frameworks

## 1. Full-Stack Framework
Such frameworks are a one-stop solution for all developer requirements. Form generators, form validation, and template layouts are usually available with a typical full-stack framework.


## 2. Microframework
These are lightweight frameworks that don’t offer additional functionalities and features, such as database abstraction layer, form validation, and specific tools and libraries. Developers using a microframework need to add a lot of code and additional requirements manually.

## 3. Asynchronous Framework
Gaining popularity recently, any asynchronous framework is a microframework that allows for handling a large set of concurrent connections. Typically, an asynchronous framework built for Python uses the programming language’s asyncio library.
