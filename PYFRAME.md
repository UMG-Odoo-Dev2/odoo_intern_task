## Types of Python Framework
- The framework is a collection of modules and packages
that enable developers to easily create applications and services
- Using Python frameworks helps reducing development time as it provides a prebuilt implementation of redundant tasks
- There are majorly three types of frameworks as follows
  #### 1. Full Stack Framework
    - suitable for both front-end and back-end development
    - offer all web development requiremets such as form generators, form validation and template layouts
    useful for various applications
    - Eg. Django
  #### 2. Micro Framework
    - a lightweight, easy-to-use framework
    - don't provide any extra features like data-abstration layer, form validation,etc.
    - require lots of code and additional requirements manually
    - *"core [is] simple, but extensiable"*
    - useful for mid-size applications
    - Eg. Bottle
  #### 3. Asynchronous Framework
    - recently gained popularity
    - work with the Asyncio library
    - mostly run large numbers of concurrent connections in software and applications
    - Eg. Growler
