# Lambda
A lambda function is a small anonymous function. A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.

What is lambda function used for?

```bash
  A lambda function is typically used to define the filtering logic and is passed as the first argument of filter() . An iterable like a list object is passed as the second argument to the filter function.
```

Is lambda faster than def?

```bash
The lambda keyword in Python provides a shortcut for declaring small anonymous functions. Lambda functions behave just like regular functions declared with the def keyword. They can be used whenever function objects are required. Creating a function with lambda is slightly faster than creating it with def .
```

What is the difference between lambda and function in Python?

```bash
  The primary difference between a lambda and a regular function is that the lambda function evaluates only a single expression and yields a function object. Consequently, we can name the result of the lambda function and use it in our program as we did in the previous example.
```

What is the advantage of lambda function in Python?

```bash
Lambda functions allow you to create small, single-use functions that can save time and space in your code. They ares also useful when you need to call a function that expects a function as an argument for a callback such as Map() and Filter() .
