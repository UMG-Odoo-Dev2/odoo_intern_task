# Lambda

## What is a lambda coding?
Lambda provides a programming model that is common to all of the runtimes. The programming model defines the interface between your code and the Lambda system. You tell Lambda the entry point to your function by defining a handler in the function configuration.

## How does Lambda work in backend?
 AWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that lets you run code for virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers. You can trigger Lambda from over 200 AWS services and software as a service (SaaS) applications, and only pay for what you use.

 ## The purpose of lambda
- Lambda runs your code on high availability compute infrastructure and performs all the administration of your compute resources.
 - This includes server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code and security patch deployment, and code monitoring and logging.

## The benefit of Lambda in Python
- The lambda keyword in Python provides a shortcut for declaring small anonymous functions.
 - Lambda functions behave just like regular functions declared with the def keyword. They can be used whenever function objects are required.

 ## What are lambda functions give example?
You use lambda functions when you need a small function for a short time – for example as an argument of a higher order function like map or filter . The syntax of a lambda function is lambda args: expression 

## What is lambda in programming?
Lambda expressions (or lambda functions) are essentially blocks of code that can be assigned to variables, passed as an argument, or returned from a function call, in languages that support high-order functions. They have been part of programming languages for quite some time.

## What is lambda function used for?
A lambda function is typically used to define the filtering logic and is passed as the first argument of filter() . An iterable like a list object is passed as the second argument to the filter function

## Are lambdas faster than functions?
Being anonymous, lambda functions can be easily passed without being assigned to a variable. Lambda functions are inline functions and thus execute comparatively faster.

## What is Lambda and how it works?
Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, and logging.

## We run a Lambda function in Python:
To create a Python function

    Open the Lambda console .
    Choose Create function.
    Configure the following settings: Name – my-function . Runtime – Python 3.9. ...
    Choose Create function.
    To configure a test event, choose Test.
    For Event name, enter test .
    Choose Save changes.
    To invoke the function, choose Test.
